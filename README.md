# Divine Intervention

Adds some mixin injectors. Currently, this includes:

## ModifyOperand
Takes the topmost value on the operand stack and passes it to a handler method,
optionally also capturing the target method arguments, and replaces it with the
handler method's return value.



## EnumInject
Adds a constant to an enum.
